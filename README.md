# AU-CircuitPy-NumPad
New or altered Macros for the Number Pad style box from Autodesk University 2023

The posted .py files are modified scripts for the Macro/Number Pad kit that I was priveledged enough
to have the opportunity to build while attending Autodesk University and the Design & Make Expo.

The files can be added to the "macros" folder and will be selectable via scrolling once the pad reboots.
